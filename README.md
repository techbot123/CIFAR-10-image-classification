# CIFAR-10-image-classification
Built a Convolutional Neural Network model to classify images into 10 categories using CIFAR 10 database

Used TensorFlow and Jupyter Notebook and the code is written in Python. Feel free to download this project and make sure to increase the 
number of iterations to get a better accuracy.

Using an iteration of 1000 in the model will give you a good accuracy of 70%. Notice that I haven't added optimization techniques to boost 
the accuracy.

Feel free to tweak the model and play with it.
Thank you:)
